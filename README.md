# -SCG-HMH-Design-Spec-Intergration-Caculations
The SCG-HMH (Smart-Cryogenic HTS-MHD Hybrid Generator) is an open-source conceptual project exploring, combustion-free power system. It uses air-sourced nitrogen, cryogenic expansion, flux-pinned HTS bearings, superconducting induction, and pulsed MHD plasma harvesting to convert waste heat into electricity with apparent COP >1 via regeneration.
